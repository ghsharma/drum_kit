# drum_kit

We all must have seen a drum kit in some concert or elsewhere, it is a collection of drums, cymbals and other percussion instruments. But have you ever imagined making that drum kit on your own virtually with the help of some scripting language (JAVA SCRIPT)? Well, so here we are with the drum kit app that runs in the browser. A Website where, when the user is tapping on the keyboard or clicking on a particular button the sound of the various drum sounds comes and there you have your own virtual Drum ENJOYYY!!.
